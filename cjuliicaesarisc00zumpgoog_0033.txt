perhaps for this reason that he was not content with the substenoe
of regal power, but was anxious also to have the outward signs of
royalty, and thereby, as it were, to legalise thet which he possessed.
An attempt was accordingly made by Μ. Antony to offer him the
diadem in February 111. 44; but as the people received the pro-
posal with coolness, Caesar for the present declined the honour.
How much he was bent upon obtaining it, however, became manifest
soon after. when two of the tribunes were sent into exile for having
ventured to manifest their disapproval of conferring upon him the
kiogl title.

n Onye of his great plens was to secure the eastern 11111111111111
crupire by a war against the Parthians, for which some preparatione
had already been made. When the Sibyllina books were consulted
respeeting the undertaking, they were reported to state that the Par-
thians could be conquercd only by a iringa and one of ansar's
friends aedordingly was to bring forward a proposal in the senate,
that Caesar out ol Italy should be permitted to assume the title of
king. em this scheme was frustrated3 fora conspiracy had been
formed against the life of the dictator at the very beginning of the

persona were privy to it. Their preterit was the restoration of the
republic; but with the exception of Brutus, there was perhaps not

mercifully treated, and promoted to high honours, by him whom they
now conspired to murder3 and othersfsuch as'Cassius, bad no other
motiva except wounded pride and thwarted ambition. The terh of
March, the day on which Caesar wasto receive the title of king,
was fixed ¹upon by the conspirators as a lit opportunity for carrying
their .tlesign into 'effect‘ When Caesar, having been cautioned in

him, aa if 111 were about to ask some favour, and then gave him the g

Brutus, whom bs loved like a son, among the conspirators3 he then
serapt himself up in his toga, and sank efter receiving twenty-three
wounds. He died io the fiftyminth year of his age, 111, 14.
